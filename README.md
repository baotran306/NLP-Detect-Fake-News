## NLP - Detecting Fake News
### I will build a model to classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.
- First of all, I will clean text in dataset.
- Then, I will build a TfidfVectorizer on news dataset. 
- Then, i initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. 
- In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix in sklearn tell us how well my model fares.
